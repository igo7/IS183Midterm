            <p class="accent"> For centuries we have created coffee that the fellow man is not able to comprehend. We enjoy the 
                creative atmosphere required in our coffee houses so much that we took it to another level. 
                Though truth be told we were never started out as the best coffee house, we slowly built our 
                way up, now we are using the finest of quality coffee beans imported from all around the world.</p>
            </br>
            <p class="accent">We have followed the creative coffee making spirit of the Roman empire and combined it with Judaic
                principles which have lead us to a whole new way of brewing coffee. This has been so popular with
                the Spartans and the little children across the street for many a years. Only the finest of
                gentlemen will know of how serious we take our brewing methodology for it is what made our simple
                coffee shop the greatest coffee shop. Atleast 3 Michelin stars. 
            </p>
            </br>
            <p class="accent">We have been to many events such as the Boston Tea Party which by the way did not serve coffee. So when
                we informed them of such errors they proceeded to throw it into the harbor. There I was astounded by such
                insight, and being the magnanimous person I was I too helped out! There we then partook in a little
                drink of coffee in our finest establishment in America in Philadelphia. Though for some reason
                some people were reading the delclaration of whatever at the moment.
